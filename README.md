# TCOS MERCH (using basic knowledge)

## Stack

Frontend :  HTML + CSS + JS 

Backend/API/Webhook : Line LIFF

Storage : local storage

Overview Flow : Confirm Button pressed > send Line Message + Store in Google Spreadsheet 

## Brief Explaination 
I use local storage to track the amount of each merchandise (there's 6) and append to google spreadsheet alongside with sending Line Message since it's a small project that each person has no interaction with others, no login authenthication, in my opinion this work best as I don't have to deal with database like SQL or NoSQL as it would be hard and tedious for the other team(i.e. finance) to learn to view SQL.


## Important Note

- Work well on mobile phone since it is attached to Line's richmenu, so I focus mainly on functional over responsive since the limitation of time given(the same reason why I considered using local storage over database like firebase), on computer it may not be responsive.

- I'm always open-minded for recommendation.
